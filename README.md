# Luxury Campsite GUI 

## Description 
GUI Application that has been designed and built for a campsite owner, to allow them to manage bookings of guests. The GUI has been conceptualised by using UML modelling, making Use-case, Class & Sequence Diagrams. After completing the diagrams to conceptualise how the classes would interact, the classes were made and implemented using JavaFX.
