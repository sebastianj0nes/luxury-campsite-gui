# Luxury Campsite GUI 

## Description 
GUI Application that has been designed and built for a campsite owner, to allow them to manage bookings of guests. The GUI has been conceptualised by using UML modelling, making Use-case diagrams and then a Class diagram. After completing the diagrams to conceptualise how the classes would interact, the classes were made and implemented using JavaFX. 

## Features
Following an object-oriented approach, the following features were implemented.
- Modelling - (Use Case & Class Diagrams)
- Class interface implementation - ensuring classes interact with each other 
- JavaFX - making use of SceneBuilder to help conceptualise our GUI.

## Installation 
The finished product can be viewed by cloning the repo and running the 'AccommodationSystemGUI.java' file inside the 'gui' package.

## Usage
The application has no database, so be cautious that any values entered will be deleted upon closing the GUI.
